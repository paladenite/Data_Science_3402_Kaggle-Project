# Breast Cancer Kaggle Project

This repository is for an attempt on 

## Overview

In this kaggle challenge the goal is to be able to predict breat cancer in women, and to accomplish this we will need to:

  + 1.) Go over the data and clean it up.

  + 2.) Make a model that can accuratly predict cancer possibilities based on data information.

Our code was made with these 2 objectives in mind and my model achieved accuracy ratings roughly ~ 60% across the board, in which the example solution set only got 50%.
